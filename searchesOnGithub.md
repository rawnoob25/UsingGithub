## E.g. of keyword search within repository on github
To search for all files in a repository with the word 'imputation' in their contents (NOT their filename), do the following:
1. first, go to that repository where you think files with 'imputation' in their contents would be
2. Then in search bar (at top left as of now), type: "user:rawnoob25 imputation" (optionally, "in:file" can be added at the end- after "imputation")
